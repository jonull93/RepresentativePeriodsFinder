# Methods

The optimisation and clustering methods which are implemented here are adapted from in [Long term storage in generation expansion planning models with a reduced temporal scope by Gonzato, S., Bruninx, K., Delarue, E., 2021.](https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/tme/research/energy-systems-integration-modeling/pdf-publications/wp-esim2021-1). In the future, the mathematical models described there will be transcribed here.
