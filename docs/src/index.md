# RepresentativePeriodsFinder.jl

[`RepresentativePeriodsFinder.jl`](https://ucm.pages.gitlab\.kuleuven\.be/representativeperiodsfinder.jl/) is a Julia package to select representative periods from time series data, usually for use in capacity expansion planning models. While this is typically done using clustering techniques (see for example [TimeSeriesClustering.jl](https://holgerteichgraeber.github.io/TimeSeriesClustering.jl/stable/quickstart/)), this package is unique in that it can solve optimisation problems to select representative periods. For more information on this see these two papers:

## Reporting issues and feature requests

If you have any issues or feature requests, report them on GitLab and mention `@steffen.kaminski` or `@u0128861`. Most of the GitLab issues already there are just waiting for someone to motivate their implementation.
